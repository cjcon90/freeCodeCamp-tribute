                <hr style="margin: -20px 0 20px 0;">
                <p>
                    Herbert Chapman (1878–1934) was born on January 19 in a small mining village, between Worksop and
                    Sheffield, in Yorkshire. After a journeyman playing career as an inside forward, Chapman began his
                    managerial career at Northampton Town. Having won the Southern League Title in 1909, and seen his
                    side
                    play well against First Division sides in the FA Cup, Chapman took the opportunity to manage Second
                    Division Leeds City. The Elland Road side struggled to achieve promotion, but Chapman recruited
                    players
                    that fit his attacking vision; more goals led to bigger crowds, but the outbreak of World War One
                    was to
                    bring league football to a halt. Chapman stepped away from the game, becoming manager of a munitions
                    factory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Herbert Chapman’s legacy was to be built with two previously unfashionable clubs after the war. In
                    1921,
                    Huddersfield Town tempted him back to the game. It was here that he would demonstrate the importance
                    of
                    a dedicated manager who oversaw all elements of the club; making shrewd signings, imposing his
                    tactics
                    and coaching methods, and working with reserve sides and scouts were all jobs Chapman took on
                    himself.
                    He led Town to their first (and only) FA Cup win in his first full season in charge; consecutive
                    First
                    Division titles were to follow in 1923 & 1924.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chapman’s methods and results were gaining attention across the country. In May 1925 Chapman
                    responded
                    to an advertisement by Arsenal Football Club searching for a team manager, insisting that
                    <em>‘Gentlemen
                        whose sole ability to build up a good side depends on the payment of heavy and exorbitant
                        transfer
                        fees need not apply’</em>. The Arsenal, at the time a mid-table side with limited support, made
                    a
                    bold move when making Chapman England’s highest-paid football manager in 1925. In return he asked
                    for 5
                    years to realise his vision for the club.

                    <p>
                        Chapman brought the same single vision to the Highbury team as he had at Huddersfield. The same
                        year
                        that he became Arsenal manager, a change in the offside rule made Chapman realize that there was
                        no
                        point having attacking players on the front line, as was the style of the time; many teams
                        playing a
                        2-3-5 formation. He changed his team to a 3-4-3 formation, with two midfielders able to go back
                        and
                        help defend with the other two going forward to help attack. Tactically, Chapman’s vision became
                        known as the <strong>‘WM’</strong> formation – a 3-2-2-3 with defenders feeding the ball to
                        wingers
                        who could counter-attack at pace. This formation also made it easier for Arsenal to
                        counter-attack,
                        a favorite tactic of Chapman since his Northampton days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the club moving in the direction Chapman had wanted and the right players picked by him and
                        playing to his revolutionary tactics, he led Arsenal to their first ever trophy when they won
                        the FA
                        Cup in 1930. Arsenal went on to win their first ever league title in the 1930-31 season,
                        single-handedly down to the incredible work of Herbert Chapman. They still hold the club record
                        for
                        most goals scored in a title-winning season with 127.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fast flowing counter-attacking football centred on a strong defensive unit that had been
                        championed by Chapman was now hitting perfection and he laid the foundations for Arsenal to
                        become
                        the dominant side of the decade. However, whilst his team were mid-way through a run of three
                        successive Division One
                        titles, 55 year old Chapman succumbed to a bout of pneumonia and died at home. His Arsenal team
                        went
                        on to win back to back Football League titles soon after his passing and his legacy is still
                        alive
                        today in so many different areas of the beautiful game.

                <p class="art-body">
                    Many of Chapman's innovations survive to this day, things that seem so basic and obvious to us were
                    unheard of in his time:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The idea of the manager picking the team, it previously being done by board members.</li>
                        <li>The idea for teams to train and have meetings between matches, he also encouraged his
                            players to
                            play other sports during offseason in order to keep fit.</li>
                        <li>Chapman was also an advocate of floodlit football matches. He had them installed at Highbury
                            in
                            1932, but the FA disallowed Arsenal to use them for matches. They were only used so the team
                            could train in the evenings. It took the FA until 1950's to legalize floodlit football
                            matches.
                        </li>
                        <li>He often took his teams to Europe to play friendly matches, and was supportive of a
                            pan-European
                            tournament 20 years before the European Cup was created.</li>
                        <li>Chapman was also one of the first managers to sign black and foreign players, signing
                            striker
                            Walter Tull whist at Northampton and trying to sign Austrian international Rudy Hiden for
                            Arsenal, but the moved was blocked by the goverment's Ministry of Labour. </li>
                        <li>Even some of the basics of football were his ideas, such as players wearing numbered shirts,
                            the
                            semi-circle on the penalty area to keep players back whilst a penalty is being taken, or a
                            white
                            ball being used as it was easier to see on a muddy pitch.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    On December 9, 2011 Arsenal Football Club immortalized Herbert Chapman with the building of a bronze
                    statue outside their Eimirates Stadium, as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations. On
                    becoming Arsenal manager, Herbert Chapman stated <em>”I am going to make this the greatest club in
                        the
                        world”</em>, and for a short time before his untimely passing, he not only came true on this
                    promise
                    but also changed football forever.
